Running this requires **[node.js](http://nodejs.org)** to be installed, as well as the **npm** package manager (it almost always comes along with a node.js install).

Run `npm install` to download the CSV dependency, then `npm start` to execute the code. This will spit out the aggregate Q% and rate of matches finishing as a tie for each LL65 rundle.

The data is aggregated and quickly graphed in this [google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PN6OlJm9rUbL7VIVFnWXWUPDc8d63QstpQCUIZ_yTWw/edit?usp=sharing).
